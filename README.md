# ETH-Protect-The-Castle
Smart-Contract Ponzi Pyramid: Protect The Castle !

The castle is under attack and needs the help of its citizens to support the cost of war.

If you are a loyal citizen and help to finance the defense of the castle, the King will pay you back 2 times what you invested when its fund will allow him to.

If no one contributes to the reparation for 6 hours, the castle will fall under the attack and the last 3 citizens who financed the defense will get the Kingâ€™s Piggy bank (respectively 55%, 30% and 15%).

If you are the first one to invest after the castle has fallen, you will be the new King's Jester and take 3% of all the transactions until the castle fells again.

There are always some people to bride, so a small fee of 3% is taken to ensure the system keeps working.
